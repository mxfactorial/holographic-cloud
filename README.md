# holographic-cloud

controlling electronic signals with phonetic symbols through silicon and metal adds complexity and toil in a universe encoding light

### todo
1. add requirements for holographic data proof of concept using equipment available for purchase
1. angles are a geometric data structure. to enable computation, add requirements for recording interference patterns encoding [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)) to subsequent interference patterns. [loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) are automated in a linearly recording optical medium by simultaneously broadcasting data transformations across the angles that would have served as indexes in the loop. add sequenced data until information is complete. rewriting data is not important in a medium that reduces linear search to a flash of light
1. add 3d printing equipment to sustain development

### stretch
1. research materials capable of photochemical sublimation to avoid messy and expensive lasers
