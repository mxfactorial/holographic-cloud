# holographic-cloud

controlling electronic signals with phonetic symbols through silicon & metal adds complexity and toil in a universe encoding light

signaling `on` and `off` in its native medium reduces archaic "computation" to the world in which mathematicians dream  

### vegas strip vs public library

eliminate the subtly high cost of information which requires an offset from advertisements. the internet is almost unusable at this point

information shouldnt depend on advertisements

it belongs in a low cost library

### reading & writing
angles are a geometric data structure. to enable *transformation* as computation, record interference patterns encoding [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)) to subsequent interference patterns. [loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) are automated in a linearly recording optical medium by simultaneously broadcasting data transformations across the angles that would have served as indexes in the loop. add sequenced data until information is complete. rewriting data is not important in a medium that reduces linear search to a flash of light. and pushing the boundaries of materials and lasers is not a priority (starting out by storing and reading interference patterns across bloated pixels is fine)  

1. acquire standard holographic storage medium. options:
   - Photopolymers (Bayfol® HX from Covestro - self-developing films)
   - Photorefractive crystals (Lithium niobate doped with iron)
   - Silver halide emulsions (Slavich PFG-01/PFG-03M - requires chemical processing)
   
2. test the minimum angle required to separate the max number of data pages the storage medium can store, or page index angle

3. write forward, read in reverse:
   - writing proceeds forward through the medium (filling pages sequentially)
   - reading works backward (starting from the end of the medium)
   - index pages at the end contain angle patterns referencing content pages
   - multiple index pages can be added as content grows

4. structure artifacts as collections of transformations:
   - each artifact exists as the sum of its transformations
   - transformations are accessed through angle references
   - new states are added as transformations, not full copies
   - physics of diffraction handles the reference mechanism
   - complex transformations require either:
     - medium initialization with primitive transformations
     - composition with other media storing primitives and their angles

### primitives
interference patterns as data and its transformation

1. angle:
   - interference patterns change light's path
   - enables reading an artifact by traversing a *path* of transformations
   - angle-encoded patterns direct light through multiple transformation steps
   - sequential path traversal builds complex transformations from simple primitives
   - fixed at 20 degrees for predictable transformation steps (physically possible range: 15-30 degrees depending on material)

2. pi/2 rotation:
   - composed of multiple references to the angle primitive
   - requires four 20 degree angle transformations 
   - plus one 10 degree transformation
   - demonstrates how complex transformations are built from a primitives chain

### todo
1. add requirements for holographic data proof of concept using equipment available for purchase
2. add 3d printing equipment to sustain development
3. test scalability of data "page" abstraction

### stretch
1. research materials capable of photochemical sublimation to avoid messy and expensive lasers

\* requirements are written to evolve from currently available tech and methods so they're easier to follow and extend by others
